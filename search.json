    "text": "Michael Totty\nI’m a computational and behavioral neuroscientist interested in reverse-translating neural circuit dysregulation in psychiatric disorders. My research approach leverages a two-pronged strategy of (1) identifying cell types and circuits that are impaired in postmortem human brains with psychiatric disease, and (2) determining the functional consequences of these cell type and circuit impairments in pre-clinical models. I am additionally interested in the development of novel computational methods and data resources towards the advancement of these goals.\n\nCurrently, I’m an NIMH F32 Kirschtein-NRSA Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, advised by Dr. Stephanie Hicks and co-advised by Dr. Keri Martinowich of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development. I previously received my PhD in Neuroscience under the mentorship of Dr. Stephen Maren at the Institute for Neuroscience at Texas A&M University in 2022, and a BS in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Tennessee in 2016."

    "text": "Neural Circuits and Mechanisms of Fear Extinction\n\n\n\nPavlovian conditioning, extinction, and renewal (A) are powerful behavior models for studying the neural mechanisms underlying fear relapse. Our previous work found that optogenetic stimulation of the thalamic Nucleus Reuniens (B) is sufficient to block fear relapse in rats (C). Totty et al. Nat Comm. (2023)\n\n\nFear extinction is an inhibitory learning process by which humans and rodents alike learn to suppress fear to previously threatening stimuli. My research investigates the neural circuits that mediate this fundamental process. Using sophisticated techniques such as in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics, my previous work discovered that the thalamic nucleus reuniens plays a critical role in synchronizing prefrontal and hippocampal theta oscillations, which ultimately acts to suppress fearful memories. This work is crucial for understanding the basic brain mechanism mediating fear suppression and has implications for treating anxiety disorders like PTSD.\nKey Publications:\n\nTuna T#, Totty MS#, Badarnee M, Mourao M, Peters S, Milad M (2025). “Associative coding of conditioned fear in the thalamic reuniens in rodents and humans.” Communications Biology DOI: 10.1101/2025.03.18.643915\nTotty MS, Tuna T, Ramanathan K, Jin J, Peters S, and Maren S (2023). “Thalamic nucleus reuniens coordinates prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony to suppress extinguished fear.” Nature Communications.

Giustino et al. J Neuro. (2020)\n\n\nUncovering how core mechanisms of fear extinction is impacted due to stress is essential for advancing our understanding of psychiatric diseases. To do this, we investigate the stress and stress-related neurotransmitters, such as norepinphrine, impact neural circuitry critical to fear regulation.
