Totty et al. Unpublished.\n\n\nThis work aims to unravel the complex molecular landscapes of the human brain through cutting-edge transcriptomic approaches. This work involves creating detailed maps of the human postmortem brain with single-cell and spatial resolution, offering an unprecedented view of the cellular architecture that underlies human cognition and behavior. By conducting cross-species comparisons that span rodents, non-human primates, and humans, this research will bridge the gap between animal models and human biology. Looking ahead, this foundation will pave the way for future investigations into how these molecular landscapes change in psychiatric disease. These efforts are poised to reveal new insights into the biological underpinnings of mental health and disease, ultimately guiding the development of more effective therapies.\nKey Publications:\n\nTotty MS#, Juanes R#, Bach S, Ameur L, Valentine M, Stocker M,Simons E, Tippani M, Rosario I, Kleinman J, Page S, Saunders A, Hyde T, Martinowich K, Hicks S, Costa V. “Transcriptomic diversity of basolateral amygdala cell types across humans and non-human primates.” forthcoming.\nTotty MS, Hicks S, Guo B (2024). “SpotSweeper: spatially-aware quality control for spatial transcriptomics.” bioRxiv.

    "text": "The role of neural oscillations in emotional learning and memory. Neural oscillations have long-been proposed to facilitate neural coding that is critical to a wide range of cognitive tasks, including aversive learning and memory. Sleep plays a critical role in learning and memory by consolidating new information, and many psychiatric disorders are often accompanied by sleep-disturbances. I began my career in neuroscience by investigating the role of oscillations in sleep-dependent memory consolidation. To explore this question, I recorded field potentials from several different limbic structures during sleep following fear conditioning and extinction and found that the phase difference between amygdala and ventral hippocampal theta oscillations during REM sleep following extinction learning are correlated to successful extinction recall (Totty et al. 2017). I then expanded these investigations to awake oscillations during my graduate studies (Totty and Maren, 2022). In my dissertation work, I show for the first that a small thalamic area (nucleus reuniens) plays a critical role in synchronizing the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus to mediate the retrieval of safe extinction memories (Totty et al. 2022). Collectively, these findings are critical to developing novel biomarkers and therapeutics to improve outcomes for memory-based disorders, such as PTSD.\n\nTotty MS, Chesney LA, Geist PA, Datta S (2017). Sleep-dependent oscillatory synchronization: a role in fear memory consolidation. Frontiers in Neural Circuits. doi: 0.3389/fncir.2017.00049\nTotty MS and Maren S (2022).

Oscillatory dynamics underlying the retrieval of fear extinction memories and the role of the thalamic nucleus reuniens. bioRxiv. doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.11.11.516165\n\nLong-term storage of fear memories in the amygdala. In 2004, Greg Dale and Michael Fanselow showed that lesioning the basolateral amygdala (BLA) 24 hours after fear conditioning is sufficient to impair fear memory retention up to 16 months later. This was strong evidence that the BLA is a central site for long-term storage of fear memories. However, in 2014, Fabricio Do-Monte and Greg Quirk found that precise optogenetic inhibition of BLA principal neurons only impaired fear memory at recent (24 hours), but not remote (7 days) timepoints. This created substantial controversary in the field as it suggested the BLA may not be a long-term site of fear memory storage. To address this question, I recorded from single neurons in the BLA during the retrieval of a recent or remotely encoded fear memory and found that the BLA responds equally to both. We additionally found that ontogenetically inhibiting BLA responses evoked by either a recent or remote CS is sufficient to impair fear memory (Liu*, Totty*, et al. 2022). Collectively, this work used a wide range of techniques to definitively conclude that the BLA is indeed a site of long-term fear memory storage.\n\nLiu J*, Totty MS*, Melissari L, Bayer H, Maren S (2022).

Extinction learning is the basis of commonly used cognitive-behavioral therapies for reducing pathological fear in patients. However, extinction learning that occurs immediately (~15 min) after fear conditioning fails to result in a long-term suppression of fear in rats; a phenomenon known as the immediate extinction deficit (IED). This phenomenon has high clinical relevance as early intervention strategies are ineffective at preventing the development of stress and trauma-related disorders. During my graduate studies, I investigated the nature and cause of the immediate extinction deficit, as well as potential sex differences. In brief, I showed that the IED in rodents is not due to event segmentation as hypothesized by work in humans (Totty et al. 2019), but rather is a stress-induced impairment driven by locus coeruleus norepinephrine that acts to hyperexcite the BLA, and in-turn, impair extinction encoding (Giustino et al 2020). Additionally, I found that both male and female rats are equally susceptible to the IED despite well-documented sex differences in stress- and trauma-related disorders (Binette*, Totty*, et al. 2022).\n\nTotty MS, Payne M, Maren S (2019).

PLOS ONE. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0264797 * co-first author\n\nContextual mechanisms gating panic-like behavior in rats. Contextual cues guide defensive selection in all animals, and a continuum of defensive behaviors exists that allow animals to maximize their chance of survival in various situations. However, most of the work investigating defensive behaviors thus far has been limited to a single behavior – fear related immobility (i.e., freezing behavior). To address this, I used a modified Pavlovian conditioning procedure leveraging a serial-compound stimuli (a pure tone followed by white noise) that elicits both freezing and flight-like behavior, respectively, in rodents. I show that panic-like flight behavior driven by a SCS is specific to white noise regardless of temporal order, can only be elicited in contexts previously paired with footshock, depends on learned associations, and is dependent upon both the central amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (Totty et al. 2021). Collectively, this work demonstrates that contextual fear can summate with cued and innate (auditory) fear to drive a high fear state and switch from post-encounter (i.e., freezing) to circa-strike (i.e., flight) defensive modes.\n\nTotty MS, Warren N, Huddleston I, Ramanathan K, Ressler R, Oleksiak C, and Maren S (2021).

Scientific Reports. doi: 10.1038/s41598-021-87559-3\n\nAutomated functional assessment of upper limb activity in the home setting. Individuals with acquired injuries, neuromotor deficits, and aging adults often struggle to maintain functional independence due to decreased ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs). Accurate assessment of functional abilities is necessary to provide adequate treatment and improve clinical outcomes. Previous work has sought to automate functional assessment of individuals in the home setting using body-worn sensors to avoid biased self-report measures. However, these measures are normally restricted by assessing only specific, predefined tasks. Therefore, during my undergraduate research position, I used supervised machine learning classification with upper extremity accelerometer and electromyogram data to develop a novel method for classifying a wide range of ADLs into a functional hierarchy of behavioral significance (Totty and Wade, 2018). This study proved the feasibility of using an off-the-market product, as well multimodal sensing, to accurately classify ADLs.\n\nTotty MS and Wade E (2018).

Totty et al. Unpublished.\n\n\nThis work aims to unravel the complex molecular landscapes of the human brain through cutting-edge transcriptomic approaches. This work involves creating detailed maps of the human postmortem brain with single-cell and spatial resolution, offering an unprecedented view of the cellular architecture that underlies human cognition and behavior. By conducting cross-species comparisons that span rodents, non-human primates, and humans, this research will bridge the gap between animal models and human biology. Looking ahead, this foundation will pave the way for future investigations into how these molecular landscapes change in psychiatric disease. These efforts are poised to reveal new insights into the biological underpinnings of mental health and disease, ultimately guiding the development of more effective therapies.\nKey Publications:\n\nTotty MS#, Juanes R#, Bach S, Ameur L, Valentine M, Stocker M,Simons E, Tippani M, Rosario I, Kleinman J, Page S, Saunders A, Hyde T, Martinowich K, Hicks S, Costa V. “Transcriptomic diversity of basolateral amygdala cell types across humans and non-human primates.” forthcoming.\nTotty MS, Hicks S, Guo B (2024). “SpotSweeper: spatially-aware quality control for spatial transcriptomics.” bioRxiv.

Our previous work found that optogenetic stimulation of the thalamic Nucleus Reuniens (B) is sufficient to block fear relapse in rats (C). Totty et al. Nat Comm. (2023)\n\n\nFear extinction is an inhibitory learning process by which humans and rodents alike learn to suppress fear to previously threatening stimuli. My research investigates the neural circuits that mediate this fundamental process. Using sophisticated techniques such as in vivo electrophysiology and optogenetics, my previous work discovered that the thalamic nucleus reuniens plays a critical role in synchronizing prefrontal and hippocampal theta oscillations, which ultimately acts to suppress fearful memories. This work is crucial for understanding the basic brain mechanism mediating fear suppression and has implications for treating anxiety disorders like PTSD.\nKey Publications:\n\nTotty MS, Tuna T, Ramanathan K, Jin J, Peters S, and Maren S (2023). “Thalamic nucleus reuniens coordinates prefrontal-hippocampal synchrony to suppress extinguished fear.” Nature Communications.
