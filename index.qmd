# Michael Totty
I'm a computational and behavioral neuroscientist interested in reverse-translating neural circuit dysregulation in psychiatric disorders. My research approach leverages a two-pronged strategy of (1) ___identifying cell types and circuits___ that are impaired in postmortem human brains with psychiatric disease, and (2) ___determining the functional consequences___ of these cell type and circuit impairments in pre-clinical models. I am additionally interested in the development of novel computational methods and data resources towards the advancement of these goals.

Currently, I'm an [NIMH F32 Kirschtein-NRSA Postdoctoral Fellow](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/F32) in the [Department of Biostatistics](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/departments/biostatistics) at [Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health](https://publichealth.jhu.edu/), advised by [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) and co-advised by [Dr. Keri Martinowich](https://www.libd.org/team/keri-martinowich/) of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development. I previously received my PhD in Neuroscience under the mentorship of [Dr. Stephen Maren](https://marenlab.org/) at the Institute for Neuroscience at Texas A&M University in 2022, and a BS in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Tennessee in 2016.
