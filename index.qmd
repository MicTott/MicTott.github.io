# Michael Totty
I am a postdoctoral neuroscientist working at the intersection of molecular, computational, and systems neuroscience. My research combines transcriptomic profiling of the human brain with circuit-level studies in preclinical models to uncover how cell types and neural pathways are altered in psychiatric disease. This two-part strategy links the **identification of vulnerable cell types and circuits in postmortem human brains** with **experimental dissection of their functional roles in vivo**. In parallel, I develop new computational tools and data resources to accelerate discovery and advance our understanding of the neural circuits that underlie psychiatric disorders across species.

Currently, I'm an [NIMH F32 Kirschtein-NRSA Postdoctoral Fellow](https://researchtraining.nih.gov/programs/fellowships/F32) in the Department of Biostatistics at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, advised by [Dr. Stephanie Hicks](https://www.stephaniehicks.com/) and co-advised by [Dr. Keri Martinowich](https://www.libd.org/team/keri-martinowich/) of the Lieber Institute for Brain Development. My work is additionally funded through a [Young Investigator Award](https://bbrfoundation.org/grants-prizes/bbrf-young-investigator-grants) from the Brain & Behavior Research Foundation. I previously received my PhD in Neuroscience under the mentorship of [Dr. Stephen Maren](https://marenlab.org/) at the Institute for Neuroscience at Texas A&M University in 2022, and a BS in Biomedical Engineering from the University of Tennessee in 2016.
